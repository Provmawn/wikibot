# Wikibot
This project is based on this description:
```
Build a Wikipedia explorer. Build an app that displays a random Wikipedia page. The challenge here is in the details: can you add user-selected categories? Can you try a different “rabbit hole” version of the app, wherein each article is randomly selected from the articles linked in the previous article? This might seem simple, but it can actually require some serious web-scraping skills.
